        <h2>PREPARATION</h2>
        <p> <strong> Step 1</strong><br>
            Using kitchen twine, tie tenderloin in 4 places. Season generously with salt and pepper.<br><br>
            <strong> Step 2</strong><br>
            Over high heat, coat bottom of a heavy skillet with olive oil. Once pan is nearly smoking, sear tenderloin until well-browned on all sides, including the ends, about 2 minutes per side (12 minutes total). Transfer to a plate. When cool enough to handle, snip off twine and coat all sides with mustard. Let cool in fridge.<br><br>
            <strong> Step 3</strong><br>
            Meanwhile, make duxelles: In a food processor, pulse mushrooms, shallots, and thyme until finely chopped.<br><br>
            <strong> Step 4</strong><br>
            To skillet, add butter and melt over medium heat. Add mushroom mixture and cook until liquid has evaporated, about 25 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then let cool in fridge.<br><br>
            <strong> Step 5</strong><br>
            Place plastic wrap down on a work surface, overlapping so that it’s twice the length and width of the tenderloin. Shingle the prosciutto on the plastic wrap into a rectangle that’s big enough to cover the whole tenderloin. Spread the duxelles evenly and thinly over the prosciutto.<br><br>
            <strong> Step 6</strong><br>
            Season tenderloin, then place it at the bottom of the prosciutto. Roll meat into prosciutto-mushroom mixture, using plastic wrap to roll tightly. Tuck ends of prosciutto as you roll, then twist ends of plastic wrap tightly into a log and transfer to fridge to chill (this helps it maintain its shape).<br><br>
            <strong> Step 7</strong><br>
            Heat oven to 425°. Lightly flour your work surface, then spread out puff pastry and roll it into a rectangle that will cover the tenderloin (just a little bigger than the prosciutto rectangle you just made!). Remove tenderloin from plastic wrap and place on bottom of puff pastry. Brush the other three edges of the pastry with egg wash, then tightly roll beef into pastry.<br><br>
            <strong> Step 8</strong><br>
            Once the log is fully covered in puff pastry, trim any extra pastry, then crimp edges with a fork to seal well. Wrap roll in plastic wrap to get a really tight cylinder, then chill for 20 minutes.<br><br>
            <strong> Step 9</strong><br>
            Remove plastic wrap, then transfer roll to a foil-lined baking sheet. Brush with egg wash and sprinkle with flaky salt.<br><br>
            <strong> Step 10</strong><br>
            Bake until pastry is golden and the center registers 120°F for medium-rare, about 40 to 45 minutes. Let rest 10 minutes before carving and serving.<br><br>

        <h2>SERVINGS OPTIONS</h2>
        <p>
           <strong> Roasted Brussels Sprouts</strong><br>
            You might be wary of serving Brussels sprouts with your expensive entree because of their bad reputation, but hear me out.
            Brussels sprouts, when roasted to perfection, are like little bites of heaven.
            In fact, they actually have a sweet, creamy, nutty, and earthy flavor that will work excellently with beef Wellington. 
            They’re easy to make, too! Just toss them with butter or olive oil, parmesan or Asiago cheese, and season with salt and pepper.
            They're crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, all thanks to a light drizzle of olive oil<br><br>
            
           <strong> Cracker Barrel Baby Carrots</strong><br>
            While beef Wellington has a variety of textures, it’s mostly soft and tender. So, you might want to give your meal a bit of crunch in the form of baby carrots.
            For me, there’s no better option than these tender and buttery Cracker barrel carrots. 
            Adding brown sugar helps to caramelize them, bringing out their natural sweetness. It’s so simple.
            In fact, you only need one pot and about 15 minutes.<br><br>

           <strong> Roasted Root Vegetables</strong><br>
            Give your beef Wellington a nutritious and colorful side by pairing it with some roasted beets, parsnips, carrots, and more.
            They’re not only vibrant, but flavorful as well. These veggies are sweet, earthy, and crunchy, and work wonderfully with the tender Welly.<br><br>

           <strong> Carrot Puree with Ginger</strong><br>
            Alternatively, if you want to give your beef Wellington a touch of brightness minus the crunch, you can puree the carrots instead.
            It’s easy! Just cook the carrots with seasonings until tender, then puree.
            The ginger is optional, but it adds such a wonderful warmth that I highly recommend it!
            Place a dollop of this refreshing mixture next to your Welly, and you’ll have a stunning dish.<br><br>

            <strong> Asparagus with Hollandaise Sauce</strong><br>
            Beef Wellington is a classic dish, so it makes sense to serve it with an equally classic side.
            Nothing better fits the bill than simple asparagus with hollandaise sauce.
            The combination of crunchy sauteed or steamed asparagus topped with rich and creamy hollandaise is all you need to complement your phenomenal entree.<br><br>

            <strong> Grilled Broccoli Recipe</strong><br>
            Here’s another veggie that pairs well with Beef Wellington – broccoli. To prepare, just give this cruciferous veg a good char by grilling it.
            A little bit of a black char never hurts, in fact, it will even elevate the flavors of your broccoli to a new level.<br><br>

            <strong> Frisée Salad with Bacon, Croutons and Poached Egg</strong><br>
            Or actually, any fresh salad. Salad is great with the decadent beef Wellington because it’s simple, refreshing, crunchy, and not to mention, nutritious! 
            Any combination of greens, nuts, fruits and veggies, protein, cheese, and dressing is great, but this is my favorite!
            The mix of crispy lettuce and salty bacon with that wonderful runny yolk is just *chef’s kiss*<br><br>
            
            <strong> Risotto with Mushrooms</strong><br>
            Apart from vegetables, starches also pair well with beef Wellington. Plus, starchy dishes are heavy, so they’re great at satisfying your hunger.
            A decadent serving of risotto infused with earthy mushrooms is perfect for beef Wellington. It’s delicious, filling, and just as elegant as your main.
            Want to give it an even more umami flavor? Top it with some shaved truffles!<br>
